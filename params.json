My specialty is data science and business intelligence.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from my resume, I have recently completed my internship at the corporate research centre of ABB, where I worked on data anonymization techniques that allow the analysts to perform data mining tasks without the need for the data owner to disclose sensitive information. This task required to maintain the properties necessary to perform data analytics, without disclosing any other sensitive information. This internship allowed me to increase my knowledge on data mining algorithms and to find solutions to non-trivial problems (such as anonymization). Moreover, I learned how to present and document the results of my work to the management and other stakeholders. \r\n\r\nDuring my studies I had the opportunity to work on several data mining projects with different teams. The latest was the creation of a classifier able to distinguish between spam comments and human comments on the Reddit.com website. To complete this project we used several different big data technologies, such as Hadoop, Spark and Google BigQuery. \r\n \r\nIf you are interested in my profile, or you have any questions, feel free to drop me an email at:\r\n<a href=\"mailto:hello@alessandromarrella.com\">hello@alessandromarrella.com</a>",
