<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer with experience in Scala and theoretical background in data science and machine learning with experience in Hadoop, Spark and Kafka. 
</p>

<p>In July 2017 I started working as Software Engineer at Gilt (HBC Digital) in the Personalisation Team. </p>

<p>Before that, I used to work as Data Scientist in the Data Science and Solutions team in AIB, one of Ireland's major retail banks with ~ 2.2 million customers. I improved the customer experience and created value for the bank by developing solutions able to provide real time insights. I developed solutions in Scala and Python, leveraging technologies such as Hadoop, Spark Streaming, Kafka, BigSQL, HBASE and Solr. One of the applications I developed with my team won the <a href="https://tdwi.org/articles/2017/07/07/tdwi-announces-2017-best-practices-awards-winners.aspx">2017 TDWI Best Practices Award for Data Management Strategies.</a>
</p>

<p>I graduated cum laude in Computer Science (with major in Business Informatics) at the University of Pisa with a thesis written during my internship at the corporate research centre of ABB in Germany. I did research on privacy preserving machine learning algorithms for the Industry 4.0. From my research activity, a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7830736/">paper</a> has been presented to the IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom). The work has been published in the conference proceedings.
</p>

<p>During my studies and my work experience I had the opportunity to work on several machine learning and data engineering projects with different teams. Some of them are listed below. Many of them are listed in my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandromarrella">Linkedin</a> profile. </p>
