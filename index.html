<p>In October 2016 I graduated cum laude in Computer Science with major in Business Informatics at the University of Pisa and I started working in the Data Science and Solutions team in AIB, one of Ireland's major retail banks with ~ 2.2 million customers. I improve the customer experience and create value for the bank by developing solutions able to provide real time insights. To do so, I develop solutions in Scala and Python, leveraging technologies such as Hadoop, Spark Streaming, Kafka, BigSQL, HBASE and Solr.
</p>

<p>In August 2016 I completed my internship at the corporate research centre of ABB, where I worked on data anonymization techniques that allow the analysts to perform data mining tasks without the need for the data owner to disclose sensitive information. This task required to maintain the properties necessary to perform data analytics, without disclosing any other sensitive information. This internship allowed me to increase my knowledge on data mining algorithms and to find solutions to non-trivial problems (such as anonymization). From the research done in ABB, a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7830736/">paper</a> has been presented to the IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom). The work has been published in the conference proceedings.
</p>

<p>During my studies and my work experience I had the opportunity to work on several data mining and machine learning projects with different teams. Many of them are listed in my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandromarrella">Linkedin</a> profile. </p>
