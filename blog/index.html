<p>I'm a Software Engineer doing functional programming in Scala with the typelevel stack (cats, cats-effect, fs2, http4s, shapeless, etc). I try to apply functional programming principles (such as immutability, total functions, referential transparency) and category theory with patterns such as free monads and tagless final wherever possible to have the compiler do the heavy lifting in ensuring the correctness of my programs. I also have a good machine learning and data engineering background.<br />
I love having the ability to do continuous deployment to production, taking full ownership of the service and everything around it (such as monitoring, infrastructure - currently playing around with Kubernetes, security).<br />
In July 2017 I started working as Software Engineer at Gilt in the Personalization Team (Gilt has been divested by the parent company HBC - where I remained together with all the tech team) . Here I develop Scala microservices on AWS.<br />
Before that, I used to work as Data Scientist in the Data Science and Solutions team in AIB, one of Ireland's major retail banks. I developed solutions able to provide real time insights in Scala and Python, leveraging technologies such as Hadoop, Spark Streaming, Kafka, BigSQL, HBASE and Solr. One of the applications I developed with my team won the 2017 TDWI Best Practices Award for Data Management Strategies.<br />
I graduated cum laude in Computer Science (with major in Business Informatics) at the University of Pisa with a thesis written during my internship at the corporate research centre of ABB in Germany. I did research on privacy preserving machine learning algorithms for the Industry 4.0. From my research activity, a paper has been presented to the IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom). The work has been published in the conference proceedings.
